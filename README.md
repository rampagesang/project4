# TeachAid
A MERN app that solves a school's "Student of the Month" conflict. This app helps the school's assembly be more organized and prevent teachers from submitting the same student for student of the month. Teachers and administration can now view the students of the month of the current month and the students whom they've submitted for the entire year.
